# Optimization-Problems-QAP-and-sphere-function-
 algorithms developed in scientific initiation (2019-2020) as a suggestion for solving QAP problems and sphere function.
 
 The QAP problem was approached with genetic algorithm and local search.
 
 The sphere problem was approached with differential algorithm and local search.
 
 The QAP main cod was located on QAP/app.c and your auxiliar functions in QAP/funcoesExtras.c
 
 The sphere main cod was located on Sphere function/app.c and yout auxiliar function in Sphere function/funcoesExtras.c
